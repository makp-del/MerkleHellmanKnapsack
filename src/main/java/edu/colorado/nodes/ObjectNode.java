/**
 * The ObjectNode class represents a node in a singly linked list structure.
 * Each node stores a piece of data (an Object) and a reference (link) to the next node in the list.
 * This class provides various methods to manipulate nodes within a linked list, such as adding nodes,
 * copying lists, and finding nodes based on position or value.
 * <p>
 * Key Features:
 * - Ability to create and link nodes, forming a singly linked list.
 * - Support for adding nodes, removing nodes, and accessing data and links.
 * - Utility methods for copying lists, both iteratively and recursively.
 * - Support for computing the length of a list using both iterative and recursive approaches.
 * - Additional methods for extracting parts of a list, displaying every third element,
 * and searching for nodes by their data.
 * <p>
 * Example Usage:
 * - Create a node with data and link it to other nodes.
 * - Traverse the list starting from the head node, accessing data or applying operations to nodes.
 * - Copy an existing linked list into a new list.
 * <p>
 * Pre-condition:
 * - The data for each node may be null, and the link may also be null (indicating the end of the list).
 * <p>
 * Post-condition:
 * - A singly linked list is formed with each node correctly referencing the next node in sequence.
 * - Methods operate on the linked list to modify, traverse, or manipulate its nodes.
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Most methods operate in O(1) time for individual node operations (e.g., setting data or link).
 * - Methods that traverse or copy the entire list have O(n) complexity, where n is the number of nodes.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * - This class is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate fundamental linked list operations
 * and may not be optimized for production use.
 * - The class assumes that data stored in nodes can be compared using standard Java object comparison techniques.
