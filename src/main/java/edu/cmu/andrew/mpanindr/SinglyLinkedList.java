/**
 * The SinglyLinkedList class represents a singly linked list where each node points to the next node in the list.
 * It supports operations such as adding nodes to the front or end, retrieving nodes by index, counting nodes,
 * and iterating through the list.
 * <p>
 * This class utilizes the ObjectNode class to represent individual nodes, which hold both the data and a link to the next node.
 * <p>
 * Key Features:
 * - Adding nodes to the front or end of the list.
 * - Counting nodes and retrieving data from specific nodes by index.
 * - Duplicating the last node of the list.
 * - Iterating through the list with methods like reset(), hasNext(), and next().
 * - Retrieving all nodes as an ArrayList of Strings for easier handling.
 * - Provides a string representation of the list with the toString() method.
 * <p>
 * Pre-condition:
 * - The data added to the list should not be null (although the class does not explicitly check this).
 * - For some operations like retrieving nodes, the index must be within valid bounds.
 * <p>
 * Post-condition:
 * - The list maintains an ordered collection of nodes, and operations like adding, retrieving, and iterating work as expected.
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Most operations such as adding to the front or end, or resetting the iterator are O(1) as they only modify or access single nodes.
 * - Retrieving nodes by index and iteration methods have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.
 * - The toString() method also operates in O(n) time, as it needs to traverse all nodes to generate the string.
 * <p>
 * Example Usage:
 * - A SinglyLinkedList can be initialized and populated with data by adding nodes.
 * - The class provides convenient methods for counting nodes, retrieving nodes by index, and iterating through the list.
 * - It is commonly used for linear data structures where each element points to the next, making it efficient for ordered traversal.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * - This implementation assumes that null values are not used as node data, although they are technically allowed.
 * - The class is designed for educational purposes and may not handle edge cases or memory optimizations typically expected in production environments.
